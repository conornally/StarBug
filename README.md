# Proposal

> This will work as a stand alone tool for observational astronomy
> You will be able to conduct general manipulations onto fits images
> You can pair it with daophot in order to use a more tested photometry tool and do simple statistics with this package
> WHEN THEY FIX PHOTUTILS you will be able to do photometry on your data too
